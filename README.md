The above article is about SustainaPrint, a more sustainable method of 3D printing that also addresses the drawbacks of using biodegradable plastic exclusively in a print. 3D printing is a very influential and innovative technology that allows us to manufacture things like prosthetics, machinery parts, and now even organs. However, this technology is impactful not just from a technological standpoint but also an environmental one. Due to this, there have been many efforts to 3D print using more eco-friendly materials. While this is a great step, many of these materials are not very strong.

The article discusses a new method of 3D printing that identifies weak points in the object, or places where they are most likely to experience stress, and reinforces those areas using a stronger material while printing the rest of the object with the green alternative. This reduces the total amount of plastic being used while still producing a usable object. I thought this article was super interesting because it highlights how technology can be used to promote environmental sustainability, which is a topic with immense relevance today.

That is clever. I like how SustainaPrint's solution doesn't simply replace all regular 3D printing plastic. Instead, the approach selectively substitutes areas that experience less force with sustainable plastic, while keeping the parts that require durability unchanged.

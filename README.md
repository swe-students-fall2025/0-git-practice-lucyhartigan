The above article is about SustainaPrint, a more sustainable method of 3D printing that also addresses the drawbacks of using biodegradable plastic exclusively in a print. 3D printing is a very influential and innovative technology that allows us to manufacure things like prosthetics, machinery parts, and now even organs. However, this technology is impactful not just from a technological standpoint but also an environmental one. Due to this, there have been many efforts to 3D print using more eco-friendly materials. While this is a great step, much of these materials are not very strong.

The article discusses a new method of 3D printing that identifies weak points in the object, or places where they are most likely to experience stress, and reinforces those areas using a stronger material while printing the rest of the object with the green alternative. This reduces the total amount of plastic being used while still producing a usaable object. I thougt this article was super interesting because it highlights how technology can be used to promote environmental sustainability, which is a topic with immense relevance today.
